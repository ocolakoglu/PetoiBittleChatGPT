"# PetoiBittleChatGPT" 
This Project provides a conversation between a robot dog Petoi and Chat GPT.
I used this robot. https://www.petoi.com/
I have a command set for the robot and while I am chatting with the robot, the robot can find the right command.
For example 
me:Hey buddy, let's walk
robot:I love walking. Let's do it. The command is The relevant command for your greeting is:##kwkF##"

I catch the "##kwkF##" command and I send it to robot with bluetooth.

I used OPEN AI api and ChatGPT 4oMini model.

You can see the action here.
